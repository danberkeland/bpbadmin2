# Submitting Prepreshaped values

Looks like both BPBN and BPBS submit total qtys for non-croix almond products
when pdfs are generated.

But... this means both BPBN and BPBS numbers are written to the same
product field (prepreshaped), meaning the value stored there could vary a lot
depending on which pdf was last exported.

Do prepreshaped values for these products get used for anything?
